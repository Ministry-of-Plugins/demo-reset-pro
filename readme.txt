#### How to set a WordPress website back to THAWED state? (Valid for both Free & Pro plugins)

*   To put the website back into THAWED state (Exit the Demo Mode), please remove all Reset Points.

#### Why is it always advised to try the Demo Reset Free version before having the Pro version?

*   Both URL-based Reset Runner systems are available in the Free Plugin version and Pro version. Therefore, we strongly advise you to use the Free version to determine which Reset Runner system and external trigger source works best for your WordPress website. Different websites have different internal and external setups, firewalls, and CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) that may block external triggers.

#### What makes WordPress Cron unsuitable for triggering a website reset?

*   WordPress cron is a pseudo-cron system that triggers when a page is loaded. Therefore, it is unreliable for triggering a robust (consistent) Website Reset Process without running into numerous issues. For this reason, the trigger must come from outside the WordPress system. Demo Reset provides highly secure reset trigger mechanisms via Reset Runners to address this problem.

#### Are Reset Runners safe? 

*   Yes, they are created with a unique randomly generated 15-character token, making them highly secure. Once created, a Reset Runner should always be kept confidential.
